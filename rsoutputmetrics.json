They can be electrically conductive or nonconductive depending on the environment.\n   - **Leggings and Guards**: Protect against heat, impact, and compression hazards. Options include metatarsal guards, toe guards, and combination foot and shin guards.\n\n2. **Eye and Face Protection**:\n   - **Safety Spectacles and Goggles**: Protect against impact, dust, and splashes. Goggles can fit over corrective lenses.\n   - **Welding Shields and Laser Safety Goggles**: Protect against intense light and radiant energy.\n   - **Face Shields**: Protect against splashes and sprays of hazardous liquids.\n\n3. **Head Protection**:\n   - **Hard Hats**: Protect against impact, penetration, and electrical injuries. Ensure long hair is covered to prevent entanglement in machinery.\n\n4. **Hand and Arm Protection**:\n   - Gloves should be selected based on the specific tasks and hazards, such as chemical resistance and physical protection.\n\n5. **Special Purpose Shoes**:\n   - **Conductive Shoes**: Reduce static electricity buildup in explosive environments.\n   - **Electrical Hazard Shoes**: Nonconductive to prevent electrical circuit completion.\n\nEmployers are responsible for conducting a hazard assessment to determine the necessary PPE and ensuring that employees are trained in its proper use, limitations, and maintenance.
